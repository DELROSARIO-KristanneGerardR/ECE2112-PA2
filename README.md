# ECE2112-PA2
## Normalization Problem: 
Step 1: For this problem, we first need to import the NumPy library, since its needed to be able to use the functions that will later be used in the problem. Also, "np" is just an alias to make referencing shorter.
```py
import numpy as np
```
<br>
Step 2:  We then need to create a 5x5 matrix and use the random.random(()) function in order for the matrix to generate random floats and store it in variable "X".
```py
X=np.random.random((5,5))
```
